# School-System
A project to test my skills

## Project steps:
- [x] first make the project with vanilla html and css without using framework (Angular)
- [X] write my idea to make the website functional
- [ ] transform the project into angular
- [ ] use module in the project 

## What work

1- the dashboard button works\
2- the add button in every page\

- [ ] add login functionality
- [ ] create separated module for login, dashboard, parents, students, teachers and admin\
=> add more to-dos if needed

## Ideas for the website:
- [ ] remove the parent page and make this information appear in Student page, it will make easier to user to understand
- [x] in angular make the login make in it's own module and the and the others in the app module
- [ ] use json-server package to make a mock database to see how the website will bebrhavior
- [ ] make it responsive
